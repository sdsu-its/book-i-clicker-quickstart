# Gradebook

Your Gradebook contains all of your session information including the grades your students receive on clicker-based activities.

Open your Gradebook by clicking on the “Open Gradebook” button. The first time you open up your roster, it we be empty. 

Click the “Sync Roster” button to connect to Blackboard and download all of your students and registered clickers.
