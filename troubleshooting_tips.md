# Troubleshooting Tips

**Frequency Conflict**: If you encounter a frequency conflict, you may need to change both your base receiver and your remote to a different frequency. You must also inform students of the new frequency so they can change their student remotes.

To change the frequency on a remote, push and hold the orange power button until a two letter code flashes on the remote. Enter the new frequency code. If you select the correct frequency \(the same frequency as the base receiver\), you will see a checkmark.  It is important to change the frequency and save the settings in the software before changing the remote frequencies.
