1. Open the i&gt;clicker app from the i&gt;clicker folder on your flash drive.
2. Create a new course by clicking the '+Create' button.

### General Tab

1. Enter your **Instructor Remote ID**, which is found on the back of your blue remote. \(Enter this number carefully as this used to start and stop polls, display polling results, and set a correct answer.\)
2. In most cases, you will be using **Frequency Code** AA

NOTE: You may want to turn off the frequency alert message as it will display every time you open the software.  Click the drop down menu under "**Show frequency alert message:**" and choose "Not at all."

NOTE: On Mac software, you should also click on **Prevent App Nap** to prevent your software from "sleeping" between questions.

### REEF Polling Tab

If you are going to allow web-based polling in your course, click the Reef Polling tab. If not, move on to Gradebook Tab.

NOTE: You should not create a separate REEF account _outside_ of the i&gt;clicker settings. Use the i&gt;clicker software. Creating a separate REEF account on the REEF website will create a new, separate course that is not linked to your i&gt;clicker course and students will not be able to join a poll or quiz.

1. Click "**Enable REEF Polling**"
2. Click "Create Account" if this is your first time enabling REEF in a course
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Click "I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use"
5. Click "Create"

6. Fill in the **Course Name** - it's a good idea to add the semester and date/time if that could be important.

7. The **End Date** allows the course to no longer be visible after the End Date so that students won't see it next semester.

8. Most faculty "Do not allow" students to view screenshots. However, some like to allow students to see the screenshots so that students can use it as a study guide later.

9. No need to fill out the Optional section. 

10. Click "Create"

You will have a chance to review and edit your settings before moving to the next tab.

NOTE: Students who use REEF must enter their REDID as their student ID in order to be recognized by Blackboard.

### Gradebook Tab

i&gt;clicker integrates with Blackboard making it easy to download your roster and upload grades. Your course must be "available " so that i&gt;clicker can make the connection. 

Click on “**Select Course**” to start the connection process. A login window should appear

NOTE: If you don't see "Select Course," you might not have the Blackboard integration software.

You will need to get your SSO key from Blackboard in order to connect i&gt;clicker to Blackboard. The SSO can be found in any Blackboard course that you teach. 

1. Go to Course Tools in the Control Panel. 
2. Click on “i&gt;clicker Instructor Tools” at the bottom of the list. 
3. Click "SSO Security Key" and copy the Security Key \(The CMS username is your REDID\). 
4. Enter your REDID in LMS Username and the Security Key in the appropriate box.
5. Click "Save my credentials ..." and then click "Log in"

A drop down menu should appear. Click on your course and then click "Select."

Once you select your course, you will be notified that your roster will not appear until you sync with your LMS; this message can be safely ignored, as you will sync your roster using the i&gt;clicker Gradebook later.



### Toolbar

While you are polling your students, i&gt;clicker will display a small Toolbar on your screen with pertinent information for both you and your students.

The most important option is the Timer. By default, polls only close when you close them. Many users choose to have a “Count Down” timer which closes the poll automatically when the time elapses. This eliminate having to tell students when the poll will close.

You can enter the desired poll duration in the box using the dropdown menu.

### Scoring

Think of the Participation Points as “Attendance” and the Performance points as “Quiz Points."

Participation Points and Performance points can be uploaded to Blackboard as separate columns if desired or as a grand total.

Many instructors are moving away from “Participation points”, favoring “Points for responding” instead to keep students engaged.

Save your settings before you exit. You are now ready to begin a polling session.
