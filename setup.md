# Initial Set Up

## Create your Course

Open the i>Clicker app from the i>clicker folder on your flash drive.

Create a new course by clicking the '+Create' button.

Type in a simple name that identifies the course. You alone will see this. Press "Create."

## General Tab

In the General Tab of the settings window, enter your **Instructor Remote ID**, which is found on the back of your blue remote.

Enter this number with care as you have the ability to start and stop polls, display results, and set the correct answer from your Instructor Remote!

In most cases, you will be using **Frequency Code** AA. 

You should turn off the frequency alert message as it will display every time you open the software. (NEED NEW PICTURE OF THE GENERAL SETTINGS WINDOW) Click the drop down menu under "**Show frequency alert message:**" and choose "Not at all."

On Mac software, you should also click on **Prevent App Nap** to prevent your software from "sleeping" between questions.

### Setting Up Your Gradebook

i>clicker integrates with Blackboard, which makes it easy to download your roster and upload grades.

Click on “Select Course” to start the connection process.

In order to integrate with Blackboard, you will need to make your course available and configure i>clicker to talk with your Blackboard Course.

In your Blackboard course, go to the Course Tools in the Control Panel. Click on “i>clicker Instructor Tools”.

You will need to obtain an SSO key, which is listed under “SSO Security Key” once you access the Instructor Tools for

i>clicker.

Copy your SSO Key, you will need it when you try to login inside the i>clicker app.

Back in the i>clicker app, go to the “Gradebook” tab and click on the “Select Course” button. A login window will appear, use your Blackboard Username (your RedID) and paste in your SSO key that you got from Blackboard.

Once you login, all of your available courses will be listed. Choose the course that corresponds with the course name that you chose earlier.

Once you select your course, you will be notified that your roster will not appear until you sync with your LMS; this message can be safely ignored, as you will sync your roster using the i>clicker gradebook.

### Toolbar

While you are polling your student,

i>clicker will display a small Toolbar on your screen, which displays pertinent information for both you and your students.

The most important option is the Timer, by default, polls only close when you close them. Many users choose to have a “Count Down” timer which closes the poll automatically when the time elapses.

You can enter the desired poll duration in the box using the Minutes:Seconds format and the dropdown menu.

### Scoring

Think of the Participation Points as “Attendance” and the Performance points as “Points Earned”.

Participation Points and Performance points can be uploaded to Blackboard as separate columns if desired (this is set when syncing scores to Blackboard).

Many instructors are moving away from “Participation Point”, favoring “Points for responding” to keep students Engaged.
