# iClicker / REEF Quick Start Guide

iClicker is an in-class response system used to quickly and easily poll or quiz students during class. iClicker can be used to test comprehension, conduct before-and-after comparisons, gather opinions, and more. REEF is the web-based version which faculty may choose to enable as part of their classroom polling.

The standard iClicker instructor kit consists of a base receiver, a blue instructor remote, and iClicker software. Each student should have their own white remote or, if enabled, a web-enabled device which is used to select responses during a polling session. (Smartphone and tablet users will need to download the REEF app from the appropriate store.)

## Software

The iClicker software is packaged in a single folder which includes the iClicker app, as well as the Blackboard integration for use at San Diego State University. The latest version of the software can be obtained by visiting the FIT Center, Adams Humanities, Room 1109. We can provide appropriate language for your course syllabus and instructions for students.
