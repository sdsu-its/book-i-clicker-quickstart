# iClicker Quick Start Guide

iClicker is an in-class response system used to quickly and easily poll or quiz students during class. iClicker can be used to test comprehension, conduct before-and-after comparisons, gather opinions, increase class participation, and more. Reef is the web-based version of iClicker which faculty may enable as part of their classroom polling.

### Instructor Kit

The standard iClicker instructor kit consists of a base receiver, a blue instructor remote, and iClicker software. Each student should have their own white student remote or a web-enabled device which can be used to select responses during a polling session. (Web-enabled device users will need to download the "iClicker Reef" app.)

### Software

The iClicker software is located in a single folder which includes the iClicker app, as well as the SDSU Blackboard Integration. The latest version of the software can be obtained by visiting the FIT Center located in Adams Humanities (Room 1109). We can help provide documentation for your course syllabus and student instructions.
