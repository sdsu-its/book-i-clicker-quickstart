# Introduction

iClicker is an in-class response system used to poll or quiz students during class. iClicker can be used to test comprehension, conduct before-and-after comparisons, gather opinions, increase class participation, and more. iClicker Reef is an application which faculty may choose to enable that allows students to select responses from a web-enabled device.

## Instructor Kit

The iClicker instructor kit consists of a base receiver, a blue instructor remote and a flash drive with iClicker software. Each student should have their own white student remote or, if the professor has enabled iClicker Reef, a web-enabled device which can be used to select responses. \(iClicker Reef users will need to download the "iClicker Reef" application.\)

## Software

The iClicker software is located in a single folder which includes the iClicker app, as well as the SDSU Blackboard integration software. The latest version of the software can be obtained by visiting the FIT Center located in Adams Humanities \(Room 1109\). We can also help provide appropriate documentation for your course syllabus and student instructions if needed.
